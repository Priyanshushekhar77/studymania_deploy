### `PROJECT SUMMERY`

Project Summary: Study-Notion Project

- **This ia an Ed-Tech platform that enables users to Create,Consume and Rate educational contents.**
- **The project utilized a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless and Responsive user experience.**

Front-End Technologies:

- React: We chose React as our front-end framework due to its component-based architecture, which enabled us to create reusable UI elements and efficiently manage state throughout the application.
- CSS Styling: We used CSS to style the application, ensuring an attractive and intuitive user interface that aligns with the Book My Show brand.
- React Hooks: Leveraging React Hooks allowed us to manage state and perform side effects, such as API calls, within functional components.

Back-End Technologies:

- MongoDB: We selected MongoDB as our database to store users details, Courses information, instructor availability, and users Rating and Reviews. Its flexibility and scalability made it an ideal choice for our application.
- Express.js: As the back-end framework, Express.js facilitated the creation of a robust API for handling user requests, managing data, and communicating with the database.

User Flow:

1. Auth Service: Users -> Admin,Instructor,Student.
2. Course Selection: Once a Instructor Creates a Course, Students can view available Courses according to their Category. They can then choose their desired Course from a Course page.
3. Payment Confirmation: When the user clicks "Buy Now," the app processes the request via Razorpay payment integration system and confirms the Purchse via Email Service.
4. Rating and Review: Users can rate and review the course contents which displayed over courses.
5. Dashboard : Profile and All details of users like courses creation,purchase etc.

Overall, we successfully implemented a educational web-page that allows users to conveniently create and consume all educational resources at one place. By utilizing React, Tailwind CSS, React Hooks on the front end, along with MongoDB and Express.js on the back end, we delivered a seamless and user-friendly experience. The web page offers the essential features of course selection,course creation,course updation, course deletion, payment confirmation, and a complete dashboard of user.
